# HackTheVerse_RED-KNIGHTS - শিখবো-E

Solution for the Education Track's Problem | Experimental Edducation in Distance Learning

To tackle this problem domain along with increasing interaction between peers, we propose our solution

## শিখবো-E

Our Solution has 3 supporting pillar module that created a complete solution prototype.They are :

- [জানবো](https://github.com/Subangkar/HackTheVerse_RedKnights/tree/main/Module%2001%20%E0%A6%9C%E0%A6%BE%E0%A6%A8%E0%A6%AC%E0%A7%8B%20AR%20Based%20Learning) : AR Assisted Teaser and Query based assignment for students to engage them with real world and MOTIVATION TO SEARCH INTERNET TO LEARN

- [করবো](https://github.com/Subangkar/HackTheVerse_RedKnights/tree/main/Module%2002%20%E0%A6%95%E0%A6%B0%E0%A6%AC%E0%A7%8B%20Hands%20on%20Simulation%20and%20Experiemnt) : A Web Platform to visualize experiments by doing hands on Simulation and a 3D Augmented Lab built using Unity to encourage real time collaboration

- [বুঝবো](https://github.com/Subangkar/HackTheVerse_RedKnights/tree/main/Module%2003%20%E0%A6%AC%E0%A7%81%E0%A6%9D%E0%A6%AC%E0%A7%8B%20Students%20Motion%20Detection%20in%20Video) : A dashboard for the Teachers to provide them an insight of how the classes are generating responses from the students

PS: [দেখবো](https://github.com/Subangkar/HackTheVerse_RedKnights/tree/main/Transcribe) is a module we did not mention in our video but to assist the distance experimental learning,we planned to extract insight from the recorded videos.
